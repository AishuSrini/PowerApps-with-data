**Introduction To Excel To App**

With Excel to App, you can choose an Excel file, generate an app from it, and then run the app you've created. Each generated app comes with screens for browsing records, viewing record details, and creating or updating records. This allows you to quickly build a functional app using your Excel data, which you can then customize to better align with your specific needs.

When you upload an Excel file, a Dataverse table is automatically created. Dataverse provides both standard and custom tables for securely storing your data in the cloud. These tables allow you to structure your organization’s data in a way that fits your business requirements, making it easier to integrate and use within your apps.

If your environment is based in the US region and AI features are enabled within your organization, the AI Copilot can assist in setting up your table. This feature can suggest table names, descriptions, data types for columns, and headers, even if some details are missing from the uploaded file. When AI Copilot is used to generate a table, a Copilot card will appear, indicating that the table was created using AI.

In this exercise, you will create an application using data from an Excel table.
